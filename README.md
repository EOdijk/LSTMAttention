Beware: source code does not conform to proper coding standards. It's pretty messy.

This program expects the several files before it can run: 
* The training and test data from Lin et al., /data/lin/train.txt and /data/lin/test.txt, can be found at https://github.com/thunlp/NRE
* The pre-trained word embeddings from GloVe, /data/glove.6B.50d.txt, can be found at https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/

To run, call /src/main.py using Python 2.7 with the arguments mentioned within.
